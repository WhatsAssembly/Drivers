# Drivers
Drivers for various devices

# Brief Description:
This is a work in progress still, don't expect much for a few months.
I'm using this respo to help teach myself about drivers and going through data sheets. I do plan to add
drivers that are meant to function alongside the TIVA TM4C123GH6PM. Feel free to message me if you have
any questions or advice on how I can improve this repo or my code.


# Future drivers I would like to add
  - XPT2046 Touch Screen Controller (HiLetgo 2.8TFT SPI [240x320] V1.2)
  - ILI9486 Driver (3.5 TFT LCD SHIELD ARDUINO MEGA2560)
